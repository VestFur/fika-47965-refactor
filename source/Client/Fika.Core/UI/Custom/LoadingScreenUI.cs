    // Why (analysis/loading-screen-peer-state, round10 2026-10-11): ReInitAfterTransit drops *every* row,
    // including the rows of peers that are still connected, and a machine announces its own row exactly
    // once - at its own re-arm (ReInitAfterTransit -> players packet) and at connect. The two machines of a
    // transit re-arm at different times (round10: the client at 20:16:06, the host at 20:17:30), so the
    // later re-arm wipes the row the earlier one had already announced. From that moment on every
    // LoadingScreenPacket of that peer reached a screen without its row and was dropped inside SetProgress
    // without a trace: the host's log holds no "progress netId=2" line at all after its re-arm, while the
    // client's own row climbed to 100 % and the client kept showing the host's row.
    //
    // The heartbeat closes that window without a new channel: while this screen is up it re-publishes the
    // local row (players packet) and the local progress on the existing packets, so a peer that re-armed
    // later re-creates the row within a second or two and then receives the current value again. It is
    // bounded (one progress line per second, one row announcement per two seconds, at most 600 s) and it
    // stops by itself when the screen is hidden, when the raid is running or when the network manager is
    // gone - i.e. exactly when the loading phase of this machine is over.
