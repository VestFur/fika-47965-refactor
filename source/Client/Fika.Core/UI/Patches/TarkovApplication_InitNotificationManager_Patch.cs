/// 47888 renamed the hooked method: <c>TarkovApplication.InitNotificationManager</c> (the name
/// this patch used up to 47242) became <c>TarkovApplication.EnsureNotificationManagerAsync</c>,
/// private and returning <c>Task</c>. The rename is confirmed on 1.2.0.47965: the interop exposes
/// <c>EnsureNotificationManagerAsync()</c> and no member of either build is called
/// <c>InitNotificationManager</c>, so the old name is not kept as a lookup - a branch that can
/// never match would only hide a future rename behind a second silent null.
