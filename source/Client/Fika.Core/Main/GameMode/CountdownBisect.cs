/// The bisect switches of the raid-start countdown
/// (<see cref="BaseGameController.CountdownScreen"/>).
///
/// Round 1 (analysis/countdown-bisect) put the three cosmetic statements behind a switch and shipped them
/// off. The 11:17 run proved that this is necessary but not sufficient: with
/// screen=False, audioFades=False, menuMusic=False the body was still entered and the process still died a
/// few seconds later, and the journal could not name the statement either - the trail had gone stale
/// (analysis/countdown-bisect-round2, Fika-crash.log).
///
/// Round 2 therefore bisects the *kept* statements as well:
///   * each of the eight remaining statements has its own journal label and its own switch, all shipped
///     ON; the label is written to the crash trail immediately (one WriteFile on the calling thread), so
///     the next run's trail names the statement even when the trail's persistor thread never writes again;
///   * a master switch - 'Skip Countdown Body', shipped ON - skips the body entirely (cosmetic and kept
///     statements alike; it jumps straight to the deploy wait and returns), which gives a raid that starts no matter which statement is the
///     aborter. The re-enable order is documented in analysis/countdown-bisect-round2/REPORT.md.
///
/// Suspect order after the 11:17 run (the death came seconds after the body was entered, i.e. while the
/// deploy wait was still pending, so nothing in the body was on the stack): 1. TimerPanel.ProfileId (a
/// managed call into the native ExtractionTimersPanel setter), 2. GameUi.gameObject.SetActive(true)
/// (activates a native hierarchy, i.e. every component's OnEnable), 3. the VOIP block
/// (FixVOIPAudioDevice -> Dissonance natives), then the pump start of the raid-view routine,
/// RestoreRaidViewAfterCountdown itself, SyncTransitControllers and the raid-started event. The master
/// switch exists so this order does not have to be guessed before the raid can be played.
