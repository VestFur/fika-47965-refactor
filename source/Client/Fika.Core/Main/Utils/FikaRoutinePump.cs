///
/// Why this exists (read analysis/host-raid-coroutine before changing it):
/// handing the engine a managed enumerator (<c>StartCoroutine(IEnumerator)</c> /
/// <c>WrapToIl2Cpp()</c>) makes it hold - and later release - an
/// <c>BepInEx.Unity.IL2CPP.Utils.Collections.Il2CppManagedEnumerator</c>. That release path is where the
/// engine dereferenced the bogus pointer 0xA twice on this build: once for the main-menu online players
/// panel (analysis/panel-crash-round7) and once during the host raid start, one frame after
/// <c>BaseLocalGame.SessionRun</c> was entered and in the frame the Fika loading screen was hidden
/// (analysis/host-raid-coroutine: the wrapper pointer named by the first-chance probe).
///
/// A routine that runs here keeps the exact shape it had as a coroutine - nesting, <c>WaitForSeconds</c>,
/// per-frame yields, <c>WaitForEndOfFrame</c> - but the engine never receives it, so it cannot be released
/// badly. A routine that has to stay a coroutine (because the engine itself drives it) keeps using
/// <c>EngineCoroutines.Wrap</c>, which writes the line that names it.
