/// The "both machines start loading at the same time" rule of a transit reload
/// (analysis/transit-reload-sync/REPORT.md).
///
/// The measured problem (round 8, host Fika-diagnostics.log 400404 ms extract of the host's own player ->
/// 412284 ms the world is gone and the loading screen is re-armed -> 464548 ms LocalGameMatching ->
/// 609161 ms LocalGameCreate; client Fika-diagnostics.log 528635 ms re-armed -> 543132 ms LocalGameMatching
/// -> 611823 ms LocalGameCreate): after a transit the client ends its raid about a second after the host's
/// own extract and already begins its next-raid flow 14.5 s later, while the host needs 60.1 s to get
/// there (4 s of the deliberate stop delay in FikaHostTransitController.Transit, 7.9 s inside
/// CoopGame.Stop, 52.3 s of native application work until its next LocalGameMatching). The client is
/// therefore ~45 s ahead before either machine has loaded a byte - and because the host's own map load is
/// also the longer one (144.6 s for TarkovStreets against the client's 68.7 s) the client sat in
/// WaitForServerToReceiveLocation for ~130 s while its own row of the loading screen was already at 100 %.
///
/// What this gate does about it: the client still ends its raid as soon as the host's landing arrives
/// (that keeps the raid-end bookkeeping, the profile save and the extraction flow where they were), but it
/// holds its own level creation until the host announces that it is starting its own load. That
/// announcement is sent from FikaHostGameWorld.InitLevelManaged, i.e. from the native step that runs before
/// TarkovApplication.LocalGameCreate, so both machines enter their native InitLevel within one round trip
/// of each other instead of ~45 s apart ("the same second"). Whoever has the shorter way to its own load
/// waits - here that is the client - and the host never waits for a peer, so a slow or absent client cannot
/// delay the host.
///
/// Every release is bounded and reported, so a machine can never be parked by a peer that is gone:
///   * the reload-start signal (the normal path, reason=host-reload-start),
///   * the transport to the host not being Connected any more (reason=transport-gone),
///   * a fresh host response that says the host has already created its raid, i.e. the host finished its
///     own load while this machine was still holding - the signal was lost or the host runs a build
///     without it (reason=host-finished-load),
///   * <see cref="ClientHoldSeconds"/> as the last resort (reason=hold-ceiling).
/// The default is chosen from the measurement (analysis/transit-reload-sync2/REPORT.md): the ceiling is
/// counted from the moment this machine reaches its level creation, and the host's own way from the
/// client's landing to its load start took 84.1 s of wall clock in the worst round measured so far
/// (2026-10-11 round 10: client LogOutput.log:2610 park -> client LogOutput.log:3193 signal, host side
/// host LogOutput.log:2693), i.e. 102.4 s counted from the arm point on the client's own clock (103.4 s on
/// the host's clock; the two wall clocks differ by ~1.1 s, measured from the signal's send and receive). 240 s covers that 2.8 times over, which matters because the host's native part grew
/// from 52.3 s (round 8) to 92.2 s (round 10) without a mod change. A host that never sends the signal
/// still ends the hold through host-finished-load or transport-gone, and the hold loads nothing while it
/// waits, so the large ceiling costs nothing on the normal path.
///
/// The signal travels as a <see cref="TransitEventPacket.ETransitEventType.ReloadGo"/> packet without a
/// payload. A receiver that does not know the type reads the one type byte and ignores it (both the
/// serializer's and the reader's default branches handle an unknown type without a payload), so a mixed
/// pair of builds cannot misparse its packet stream; a host without the signal simply ends the client's
/// hold through the fallbacks above.
