/// <para>The card check of the transfer point is ONE fact, but this build makes more than one system fire on

/// mirror), the complete set is:</para>
///
/// <list type="number">
/// <item>SENTRY - the sentry boss rule: <c>SentryBossLogic</c> (state <c>_accessedPlayerIds</c>, written by
/// the native entry <c>OnTerminalAccessGained</c>, read by <c>BossSentryHostilityRule</c> through
/// <c>IAccessBossLogic.HaveAccess</c>). Delivered by <see cref="FikaSentryAccess"/> on every machine.</item>
/// <item>GROUP - the hostility tables of every bot group of the area (<c>BotGroupHostility</c>, one container
/// per rule inside <c>BotGroupInnerHostilityData</c>). The sentry access has its own container there
/// (<c>AlliesBySentryAcces</c>), which is the second landing of <see cref="FikaSentryAccess"/>. The other
/// containers (<c>EnemiesByHit</c>, <c>NeutralsByVsRF</c>, <c>EnemiesByAiPlaceAllEnemy</c>, ...) are the
/// product of the other rules and are NOT written by this component - they are only reported, because the
/// brief forbids clearing enemy tables.</item>
/// <item>ZONE - the CODE-DRIVEN shooters of the scene, which fire no bot at all: <c>BorderZone</c> and its
/// subclasses <c>SniperFiringZone</c> (an imitating sniper: shot frequency, hit probabilities, lethal after
/// N shots) and <c>Minefield</c>. They ask <c>PlayersWithImmuneToSniperFire</c>
/// (<c>playersWithImmune : HashSet&lt;Int32&gt;</c>) through <c>IsPlayerCanBeDamaged</c>; the map trigger
/// <c>HandlerSniperZoneImmunity</c> is the native writer of that container. The shot itself is computed by
/// the authority (Fika delivers it with <c>BorderZoneEvent</c> /
/// <c>BorderZone.ProcessIncomingPacket</c>), so the container that matters is the one of the AUTHORITY -
/// which is why this component writes it on every machine that learns the fact.</item>
/// <item>GUARDED - <c>GuardedZone</c>, which keeps its own profile-id list (<c>_guardedPlayerIds</c>) of the
/// players its <c>SniperFireTargetManager</c> does not treat as aggressors. Read only here: the list means
/// 「the player the zone protects」 (its hit fires <c>_onGuardedPlayerHitTriggerId</c>), not 「the player who
/// passed the check」, so it is not a landing of the card.</item>
/// </list>
///
/// <para>WHAT THIS COMPONENT DOES: it hands the fact to system 3 through the native container and the native
/// method (<c>AddImmunePlayer(Int32)</c>), and writes the verdict of systems 2, 3 and 4 for that player into
